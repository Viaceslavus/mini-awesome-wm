## My minimalistic Awesome WM widgets

#### Motivation
There are plenty of those multicolored bloated widgets for awesome wm with a tonn of useless floating elements, showing you the weather in Paris, on Github, so I felt that this repo with my minimized widgets should become a saviour of tiling-wm world. And 'minimalistic' doesn't mean oldschool XFCE-like white boxes!  

Actually: 
- I have minimized the color palette to gray and white, which in my opinion looks pretty stilishy.
- I have completely removed all dymanic elements from the screen (like cpu usage), as they are only distracting me.
- I have no popups in my widgets as they require you to make a few more excessive mouse clicks...

And as a result I've got something like this:

Basically there are three custom widgets and they are exposed in a directowies with an appropriate names and theirs own documentation:
- [Battery Widget](https://github.com/slamko/mini-awesome-wm/tree/master/battery)
- [Volume Widget](https://github.com/slamko/mini-awesome-wm/tree/master/volume)

Clock and keyboard layout are standart AwesomeWM widgets with ```inconsolata bold 11``` font.

Main rc file is also [here](https://github.com/slamko/mini-awesome-wm/blob/master/rc.lua).

If the picture above does not look like a vile primitiveness You may want to put a star to save other users from bloated widgets :)
